# SolidWorks_CondutisForVesselImplantation

SolidWorks is a 3D solid modeling package which allows users to develop 3D models and assemblies in a simulated environment for both design and analysis. In SolidWorks, you sketch ideas and experiments with different designs to create 3D models. The benefits of using this package include time efficiency, less effort and money spent on debugging.

Complex nerve pathway requires custom nerve repair solutions. It is possible to do 3D scanning and 3D printing to make custom repair devices, especially when integrated with knowledge of biocompatible materials and growth factors needed for the situation.

Simulation of atherosclerotic plaque growth using computation biomechanics and patient specific data allow more breakthrough to happen in the treatment of affected vessels. 3D modeling can be paired with other software to model fluid flows and other situations such as diffusion, heat transfer, etc. 

I also learned about Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) and Stereoithography Apparatus (SLA) that use PLA and UV sensitive resin is used in 3D printing the models. These 3D printers can utilize STL formatted files that can be obtained from SolidWorks modeling package.
